# research.md — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Context
The repository's setup script returned JSON pointing at `specs/master/spec.md` and `specs/master/plan.md`, but the actual feature specification is located at `specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/spec.md`. The implementation plan file at `specs/master/plan.md` is present but empty. The setup script also warned that the plan template expected at `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` was not found; however a template exists at `.specify/scripts/templates/plan-template.md`.

## Decisions

- Decision: Use existing feature spec at `specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/spec.md` as the canonical FEATURE_SPEC.
  - Rationale: This file is complete and matches the user's requested project (Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics). The setup output appears generic and references `master` as a placeholder.
  - Alternatives considered:
    - Create `specs/master/spec.md` as a pointer to the real spec (adds duplication). Rejected.

- Decision: Create an implementation plan at `specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/plan.md` and use it as IMPL_PLAN.
  - Rationale: `specs/master/plan.md` is empty; keeping plan colocated with the feature spec follows Spec-Kit Plus conventions and avoids confusion.
  - Alternatives considered:
    - Populate `specs/master/plan.md` and leave feature spec where it is. Possible, but less explicit for feature-scoped work.

- Decision: Use `.specify/scripts/templates/plan-template.md` as the source plan template and copy it to `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` if necessary.
  - Rationale: The setup script expected `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`. A copy will satisfy the script and preserve the existing templates under `scripts/templates`.

## Unknowns / NEEDS CLARIFICATION

- Unknown: Should canonical FEATURE_SPEC path be `specs/master/*` or `specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/*`? (Proposed: use the latter)
- Unknown: Are there any branch naming expectations (script returned `BRANCH: master`) — should we use `main` instead?
- Unknown: Confirm whether copying plan template from `.specify/scripts/templates` into `.specify/templates` is acceptable.

## Research Tasks (dispatched agents / manual tasks)

1. Task: "Confirm canonical feature spec path for Physical AI book (specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book)" — Owner: human
2. Task: "Decide branch naming convention (master vs main) for release and update setup script if needed" — Owner: human
3. Task: "Copy plan template to expected location or update setup script to look in `scripts/templates`" — Owner: human/ops
4. Task: "Create `specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/plan.md` from template and populate high-level phases" — Owner: agent (can scaffold)
5. Task: "Run constitution check after plan created; report gate violations" — Owner: agent

## Research Findings (preliminary)

- The feature spec at `specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/spec.md` is comprehensive and will be used as the canonical spec.
- The setup script appears to use `master` as a default branch; repository branch currently is `master` (confirmed by setup output). If project prefers `main`, update scripts and CI accordingly.
- The missing plan template warning is due to differing expected path; copying the existing template will resolve the warning.

## Next Steps (Phase 0 → Phase 1 handoff)

- Create `specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/plan.md` by copying plan template and filling top-level IMPL_PLAN fields.
- Resolve the three NEEDS CLARIFICATION items with repository owner (feature path, branch name, template location).
- After confirmations, continue with Phase 1 artifact generation: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/*`, `quickstart.md`.
