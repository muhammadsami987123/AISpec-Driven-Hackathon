## Prompt

User asked to implement MVP: create Chapter Three and integrate into sidebar.

## Response snapshot

Created 5 markdown topic files under `ai-native-book/docs/part-one/chapter-3/` and updated `ai-native-book/sidebars.js` to include a Chapter 3 category referencing the new topics.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: adds Chapter Three content scaffold and navigation entry.
- 🧪 Tests: none run (manual link check recommended).
- 📁 Files: 6 files added/updated as listed above.
- 🔁 Next prompts: run `pnpm start` and verify site builds without errors; run link checks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Created initial content scaffold; further editing recommended to match tone and expand examples.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: potential sidebar dirName mismatch with autogenerated sections; verify local build.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): none
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Run the Docusaurus dev server to validate.
