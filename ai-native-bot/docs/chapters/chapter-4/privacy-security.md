## Privacy, Data Protection, and Security by Design for Bots

Practical privacy and security measures reduce risk when bots handle user data or perform sensitive actions.

### Principles

- Data minimization: collect only what is required.
- Purpose limitation: use data only for stated purposes.
- Secure storage and transmission: follow encryption and key-management best practices.

### Design patterns

- Differential privacy or aggregation for analytics.
- Access controls and role-based audits for sensitive operations.
