## Governance, Human Oversight, and Accountability Mechanisms

This section covers operational controls, human-in-the-loop patterns, and accountability frameworks required for safe deployment.

### Governance patterns

- Define decision boundaries for automated vs human review.
- Use staged rollouts and canary deployments for risky capabilities.
- Maintain clear escalation procedures for incidents.

### Human oversight

- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) where decisions have safety or legal implications.
- Labels and workflows to route uncertain cases to reviewers.
