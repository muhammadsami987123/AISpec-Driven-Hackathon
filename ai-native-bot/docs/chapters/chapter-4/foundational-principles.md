## Foundational Ethical Principles and Frameworks

This section outlines core ethical principles that should guide AI-native bot design.

- **Beneficence:** Design bots to promote user well-being and deliver clear value.
- **Non-maleficence:** Avoid harm — consider failure modes, unsafe instructions, and unintended behaviors.
- **Fairness:** Ensure equitable treatment across users and minimize discriminatory outcomes.
- **Transparency:** Communicate capabilities and limitations to users.
- **Privacy:** Limit data collection to what is necessary and practice data minimization.

### Frameworks and Practices

- Adopt principles from established frameworks (e.g., OECD AI Principles, EU AI Act guidance).
- Use checklists and design reviews to assess ethical risks early in the content lifecycle.
