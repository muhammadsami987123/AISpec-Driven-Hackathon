## Transparency, Explainability (XAI), and Trust in Conversational AI

Transparency and explainability increase user trust and support debugging. Provide clear, succinct explanations suitable for end users and technical logs for maintainers.

### Practical measures

- Provide short, user-facing explanations for nontrivial decisions (e.g., "I suggested this because...").
- Maintain audit logs and provenance for model decisions.
- Use explainability tools (feature attribution, surrogate models) for developer diagnostics.
