## Chapter 3 — The Digital Twin: Overview

The Digital Twin is a virtual replica of a physical system used to simulate, test, and validate behavior before deploying to hardware. In Physical AI, digital twins accelerate development by enabling repeatable experiments, dataset generation, and safety validation without risking real equipment.

### Why a digital twin?

- **Fast iteration:** run scenarios in parallel and at accelerated time scales.
- **Safe validation:** validate control strategies and safety envelopes in simulation before real-world trials.
- **Data generation:** produce labeled sensor data for perception models at scale.

### Chapter scope

This chapter covers common simulation engines (Gazebo/Ignition, Unity/Omniverse/Isaac Sim), trade-offs in fidelity and performance, sim-to-real transfer techniques, and practical workflows for integrating simulation into your development pipeline.

Next sections explore specific simulators, fidelity concerns, and case studies with recommended workflows.
