# Chapter 2 — Deep Dive into Physical AI Foundations

## Overview

This chapter expands on the foundations introduced in Chapter One. It explores the "Three Pillars Framework" (Simulation, Perception & Control, Embodied AI), details the Perception-Decision-Action (PDA) loop, and surveys the software and simulation tools commonly used in Physical AI development.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the Three Pillars Framework and how the pillars interact.
- Explain the Perception-Decision-Action loop and its role in closed-loop systems.
- Identify common simulation and tooling choices (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim) and when to use them.

## Structure

- `three-pillars-overview.md` — conceptual breakdown of the Three Pillars
- `pda-loop.md` — Perception-Decision-Action loop with examples
- `tools-overview.md` — tooling and simulation overview with industry examples
