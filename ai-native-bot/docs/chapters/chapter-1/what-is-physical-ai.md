## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a transformative frontier in artificial intelligence, focusing on systems that operate within and understand the complexities of the real physical world. Unlike traditional, purely digital AI, Physical AI systems possess a physical body, enabling them to directly interact with their surroundings, gather sensory data, and execute actions that have tangible effects.

### Definition & Historical Context

Physical AI is defined as AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws through embodied interaction. This concept emphasizes the integration of AI with a physical form, allowing for real-time learning and adaptation based on sensory experiences and motor outputs.

### Historical milestones (high level)

* **Shakey the Robot (1966-1972)** — early mobile robot that reasoned about actions.
* **Honda ASIMO (2000)** — early humanoid research platform demonstrating bipedal locomotion.
* **Boston Dynamics Atlas (2013-2023)** — showcased advanced dynamic locomotion.
* **Unitree, Figure AI, Tesla Optimus (2020s)** — commercial and research platforms pushing capabilities.
