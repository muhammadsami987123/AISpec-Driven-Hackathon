## The Three Pillars of Physical AI

The three pillars — Simulation, Perception & Control, and Embodied AI — form the framework for designing and deploying physical intelligence.

### Pillar 1: Simulation

Simulation (digital twins) enables safe and fast iteration, synthetic data generation, and sim-to-real transfer techniques.

### Pillar 2: Perception & Control (ROS 2)

ROS 2 provides middleware for sensors, control loops, topics/services, and real-time execution on robot hardware.

### Pillar 3: Embodied AI (LLMs + Robotics)

LLMs provide high-level reasoning and task decomposition while robot stacks handle execution and adaptation.
