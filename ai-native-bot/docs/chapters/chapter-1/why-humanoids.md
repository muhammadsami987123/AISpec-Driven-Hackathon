## Why Humanoids? Applications & Challenges

The humanoid form factor, characterized by a bipedal stance and dexterous hands, offers advantages for operating in human-centric environments.

### Advantages of the Humanoid Form Factor

* **Navigating Human Environments:** Stairs, doorways, chairs and human tools are designed for humans — humanoids can work with existing infrastructure.
* **Natural Human-Robot Interaction:** Human-like appearance and gestures help with intuitive interaction.
* **Data Abundance & Imitation Learning:** Human behavior provides abundant demonstrations for learning.
* **Dexterous Manipulation:** Multi-fingered hands enable fine manipulation tasks.

### Applications (examples)

* **Healthcare, Manufacturing, Service, Research, Exploration & Disaster Response** — humanoids are being piloted across these sectors for assistance, precision tasks, logistics, HRI studies, and search-and-rescue.

### Challenges

* **Bipedal Balance**, **Dexterous Hand Control**, **Energy Efficiency**, **Cost**, and **Safety & Robustness** are the main constraints facing humanoid deployment.
