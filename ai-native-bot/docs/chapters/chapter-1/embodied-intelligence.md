## Embodied Intelligence: The Perception-Decision-Action Loop

Embodied intelligence describes how a physical body (robot) interacts with its environment to learn, make decisions, and execute actions. This forms the Perception-Decision-Action (PDA) loop.

### Sensorimotor Integration

Robots gather information via sensors (vision, depth, IMU, force/torque) and use actuators (motors, servos) to execute actions. Real-time constraints matter: the PDA loop must be responsive to maintain stability and adapt to the environment.

### Physical World Constraints

Robots must handle gravity, friction, latency, power limitations, and wear-and-tear. Embodiment provides the advantage of learning through direct physical experience and bridging high-level LLM reasoning with grounded execution.
