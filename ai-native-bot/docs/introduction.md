# Introduction

Welcome to the AI Native Bot documentation. This site explains the purpose, capabilities, and learning material provided by the bot. The bot focuses on Spec-Driven Development (SDD) approaches and provides guided educational content about Physical AI, embodied intelligence, and practical robotics tooling.

Use the sidebar to navigate: start with this Introduction, then open the `CR Number One` section to explore Chapter 1 and its topics.

This landing page is the default entry point for readers and explains what the bot is about, how the docs are organized, and where to go next.

- **Purpose:** Teach and demonstrate Physical AI concepts and examples.
- **Audience:** Students, engineers, and researchers entering physical robotics and embodied intelligence.
- **Structure:** Introduction → Chapters → Topics (each topic has its own page).

Get started by opening the `CR Number One` section in the sidebar and selecting `CR Number One — Physical AI`.

If you prefer the consolidated full chapter text, the chapter landing page includes a link to the full Chapter 1 content.

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a transformative frontier in artificial intelligence, focusing on systems that operate within and understand the complexities of the real physical world. Unlike traditional, purely digital AI, Physical AI systems possess a physical body, enabling them to directly interact with their surroundings, gather sensory data, and execute actions that have tangible effects. This bridges the critical gap between abstract digital intelligence and the concrete realities of gravity, friction, and spatial awareness.

#### Definition & Historical Context

Physical AI is defined as AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws through embodied interaction. This concept emphasizes the integration of AI with a physical form, allowing for real-time learning and adaptation based on sensory experiences and motor outputs.

#### Historical milestones (high level)

* **Shakey the Robot (1966-1972)** — early mobile robot that reasoned about actions.
* **Honda ASIMO (2000)** — early humanoid research platform demonstrating bipedal locomotion.
* **Boston Dynamics Atlas (2013-2023)** — showcased advanced dynamic locomotion.
* **Unitree, Figure AI, Tesla Optimus (2020s)** — commercial and research platforms pushing capabilities.

### Why 2025 is the Breakthrough Year

The year 2025 is heralded as a breakthrough for Physical AI due to a remarkable convergence of technological advancements including computational power (modern GPUs and edge devices), sensor maturation (cameras, LiDAR, depth sensors), advanced AI algorithms (deep learning, RL, LLMs), robust open-source ecosystems (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim), and large-scale investment into robotics.
